/**
 * The state of a dots and boxes grid.
 *
 * A (4, 3) dots and boxes grid looks like this:
 *
 * *-*-*-*
 * | | | |
 * *-*-*-*
 * | | | |
 * *-*-*-*
 *
 * Notice that:
 *
 * - for each row, there is one less horizontal than the number of corner dots
 * - for each row, there are as many verticals as there are corner dots
 * - for each row, there is one less box than the number of corner dots
 * - for each column, there is one less vertical than the number of corner dots.
 * - for each column, there are as many horizontals as there are corner dots.
 * - for each column, there is one less box than the number of corner dots
 *
 * For example, in this (4, 3) grid, there are (3, 3) horizontal lines, and (4, 2) vertical lines, and (3, 2) boxes.
 *
 * We number all lines and boxes by their top-left coordinate.
 *
 * In Java 14+, we might use a Record class for this, but we're using 11+ as an LTS version, so we don't have that yet.
